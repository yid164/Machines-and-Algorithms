1. Given a flow network N in which all of the edges have capacity equal to one,
and given also an integer k, the problem is to delete k of the edges from N so
as to reduce the maximum flow in N by as much as possible.
Give an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. (6 marks)

Solution: 
	By deleting k edges of the flow network N

	1. Need to reduced the capacity of any cut by k as a result of the min-cut is to be redueced by at most of k, so the max-flow is to be redueced

	2. to Reduce the max-flow from N by k, need to consider minimun cut X for removing k edges exiting out of it. SO the capacity of minimum cut X is f - k. f is considered as a value of the max-flow 

	

// Create by yid164
// algorithm for Q1
// N(V, E) is the network flow

flow_network(N, k):

	if N
